# Freestyle vs Pipeline jobs

Jenkins freestyle projects allow users to automate simple jobs, such as running tests, creating and packaging applications, producing reports, or executing commands. Freestyle projects are repeatable and contain both build steps and post-build actions.

In contrast to freestyle jobs, pipelines enable you to define the whole application lifecycle. Pipeline functionality helps Jenkins to support continuous delivery (CD). The Pipeline plugin was built with requirements for a flexible, extensible, and script-based CD workflow capability in mind.
